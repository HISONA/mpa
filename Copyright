mpa is a fork of mpv, which is a fork of MPlayer/mplayer2.

mpa as a whole is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License LGPL
version 2 or later (LGPLv2.1+ in this document, see LICENSE.LGPL for full
license text)

Most source files are LGPLv2.1+, but some files are available under more liberal
licenses, such as BSD, MIT, ISC, and possibly others. Look at the copyright
header of each source file, and grep the sources for "Copyright" if you need to
know details. C source files without Copyright notice are usually licensed as
LGPLv2.1+. Also see the list of files with specific licenses below (not all files
can have a standard license header).

All new contributions must be LGPLv2.1+ licensed. Using a more liberal license
compatible to LGPLv2.1+ is also ok.

Changes done to GPL code must come with the implicit/explicit agreement that the
project can relicense the changes to LGPLv2.1+ at a later point without asking
the contributor. This is a safeguard for making potential relicensing of
remaining GPL code to LGPLv2.1+ easier.

For information about authors and contributors, consult the git log, which
contains the complete SVN and CVS history as well.

"v2.1+" in this context means "version 2.1 or later".

Some libraries are GPLv2+ or GPLv3+ only. Building mpv with Samba support makes
it GPLv3+.

The following files are still GPL only (--enable-lgpl disables them):

    bootstrap.py                    unknown license, probably GPLv2+ or LGPLv2+

None of the exceptions listed above affect the final binary if it's built as
LGPL. Linked libraries still can affect the final license (for example if
FFmpeg was built as GPL).
